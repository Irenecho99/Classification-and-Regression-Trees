# Class Description:
Introduction to algorithms and applications of classification and regression trees. Recursive partitioning, 
pruning, and cross-validation estimation of prediction error. Class priors and misclassification costs. 
Univariate and linear splits. Linear and kernel discriminant analysis and nearest-neighbor classification. 
Unbiased variable selection and importance scoring of variables. Least-squares, quantile, Poisson, 
logistic, and proportional hazards regression tree models. Tree ensembles. Subgroup identification of 
differential treatment effects. Multiple and longitudinal response variables. Missing values and multiple 
missing value codes. Comparisons with neural networks, support vector machines, and other methods. 
Bootstrap calibration and post-selection inference. Applications to business, social science, engineering, 
biology, medicine, and other fields.
